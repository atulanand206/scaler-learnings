# Lambda Expressions

Single method abstract classes or interfaces when used as an anonymous class, they can leverage the benefits of Lambda expressions.&#x20;

Lambda expressions should be concise. In most cases, you should try to use a method reference in its place.

Lambda expressions in Java can call the following

1. Instance method with parameter as argument.
2. Instance method with parameter as target.
3. Static method.
